# LiterateLean for Lean 4

`literate-lean` is a small Lean 4 library for literate-programming style source files.
It allows markdown-like prose in Lean files while executing explicit ```` ```lean ```` fenced blocks.
This is a practical example of a [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)) source style.

## Features

- ```` ```lean...``` ```` command blocks are elaborated as normal Lean commands.
- Markdown heading lines like `# Heading text` are accepted and ignored.
- Plain prose lines composed of identifiers are accepted and ignored.
